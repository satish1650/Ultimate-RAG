Ultimate RAG Course
---
Designed for AI engineers, ML practitioners, and software developers, this course transforms RAG theory into production-grade implementations. Whether you're new to retrieval systems or experienced with LLMs, you'll gain expertise in Building scalable RAG pipelines (from basic
similarity search to knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval), Implementing enterprise features (hybrid search, MCP integration, self-improving agents), Deploying optimized systems (Docker, FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS EKS), Solving real-world challenges (multimodal processing,
conversational memory, code-aware RAG). Through hands-on projects, you'll create portfolio-worthy systems including MCP-integrated code assistants and cloud-deployed multimodal RAG, all with professional monitoring and evaluation frameworks. <br>

Learning Objectives <br>
---
✅ Implement End-to-End RAG: From document ingestion (Unstructured.io, LlamaParse) to response synthesis (GPT-5, Claude 3.5) <br>
✅ Self-RAG with confidence scoring <br>
✅ Graph RAG with entity resolution <br>
✅ Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration <br>
✅ Optimize Production Systems <br>
